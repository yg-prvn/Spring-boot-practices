Project Title: Spring Boot REST API Practice

Description:
This project is a beginner-friendly Spring Boot application designed to demonstrate the development of RESTful APIs. The application showcases the use of various annotations such as @SpringBootApplication, @RestController, @RequestMapping, and @GetMapping to build a lightweight web server capable of handling HTTP requests.

The application provides the following endpoints:

/hello Endpoint:

Method: GET
Response: Returns a simple "Hello, World!" message to demonstrate a basic API response.
/hello1 Endpoint:

Method: GET
Response: Returns a personalized greeting, "Hello, Praveen!" showcasing another example of static responses.
/hello2 Endpoint:

Method: GET
Query Parameter: name (optional)
Response:
If the name parameter is provided: Returns a personalized message in the format "Hello, [name]!"
If the name parameter is missing or empty: Provides guidance to include the parameter in the URL (e.g., /hello2?name=YOUR NAME).
Technologies Used:

Framework: Spring Boot
Programming Language: Java
Development Tools: IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse IDE, Maven
Features:

RESTful API development using Spring Boot
Basic implementation of request mappings
Dynamic response generation using query parameters
Learning Outcomes:
This project helps beginners understand the fundamentals of RESTful API design, including handling HTTP requests, returning JSON-like responses, and working with query parameters. It also demonstrates the ease of building scalable and maintainable microservices using the Spring Boot framework.

Potential Enhancements:

Add more endpoints for CRUD operations.
Implement JSON responses instead of plain text.
Introduce logging and exception handling.
Integrate database support to demonstrate data persistence.
